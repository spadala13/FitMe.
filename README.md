# FitMe.


#### Description:

**Hi! Welcome to _FitMe._**
**ðŸ’ª FitMe is a web application where the user can easily keep track of their workouts which includes what time and day, how many reps, and whay type of exercise.
It was built mainly using Python and Flask in the backend, as well as SQL to store users and their data. For the aesthetics, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and BootStrap were used.**

### Problem Solved
Ever forget about what workouts you have done last time you went to gym? I know I have. After taking a break from working out for a day which ends up turning to a few weeks, I forget where I stopped at. So, this web application eliminates this problem by allowing the user to log their data and view their previous workouts on a dashbaord which are categorized based on the type of exercise. Along with that, the application also easily keeps track of the calories.
